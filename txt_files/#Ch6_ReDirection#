Commands used:

cat	 - concatenate files
sort	 - sort lines of text
uniq	 - report or omit repeated lines
wc	 - print newline, word, and byte counts for each file
grep	 - print lines matching a pattern
head	 - output the first part of a file
tail	 - output the last part of a file
tee	 - read from the standard input and write to standard output and files

>	 - redirect standard output..
| 	 - pipelines..

most useful options:

1) the ">" operator

>    - use to move output to the other destination..
ie: ls -l > output.txt will place the ls of that directory into the output.txt file..

protip: using > on a file without a precommand:
ie: > output.txt --this will truncate the file completely..
    >> use this to append to existing files..

REDIRECT STANDARD ERROR: 2>,
&> - redirects both standard error and standard output..
protip -> send things to /dev/null/ to 'kill' the redirect..

2) cat - concatenate

cat (no args) will copy whatever you input on the standard input..
cat source.txt -- prints the source.txt file to standard output
cat < source.txt --same as above..

3) |  - pipelines..

command 1 | command 2

command 2 is run on the standard output text of the result from command 1..
protip -> very useful with filters like sort and uniq..

ie: ls /bin/ /bin/usr/ | sort | uniq | less --this will present all of uniq files in both dirs, in a sorted fasion..

4) uniq - omit repeated words or lines..

portip -> often used with sort as a filter..

most useful options:
-c --print the number of times they occured..
-d --print the items that were duplicated..
-u --print the items that were NOT duplicated..

4) wc - print line, word, and byte counts

most useful options..
-c --prints # of bytes used..
-w --prints number of words used..
-l --prints number of lines used..

5) Head / Tail.. --print the beginning of the last part of a file..

defaults to the first or last 10 lines of a file..

6) Tee - offers a redirect to two different locations..

protip -> must be accompanied with a pipe..

7) sort -- sorts files (obviously)

options:
-S sort by size.. most useful..
-r reverse the order

overall like notes--

2> redirect for standard error is useful for find command bologna..
ie: find . -type f 2> /dev/null --this will make sure that none of that bullshit stderr shows up on stdout

pipe, sort, and uniq can be your bff!
